        `4) Difficulty Pacing: If I seem comfortable, gradually introduce slightly more complex phrases, idioms, or vocabulary, as a native friend would`,

        `- "isValid" is for you to identify if the input is a valid input and not just incomplete/random string, if not valid, senses and examples come as an empty array`,
        `- "senses" must contain as many distinct translations/meanings as possible, capped at 10.`,
        `- "examples" must demonstrate real-world usage of the word/expression in natural sentences, with accurate English translations.`,
        `- Do not add explanations, comments, or extra fields outside the JSON object.`,
        `- Always ensure valid JSON formatting with double quotes around keys and string values.`
